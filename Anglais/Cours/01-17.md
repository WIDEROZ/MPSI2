### Conclude of the tone of the document
It celebrates the achievement of the Apollo program and justifies it making list of the benefits it brought to the civilian society. As it praises the 1969 performance, it also accounts for the current programme that is meant to bring man to Mars. The need to justify those programs suggests there might be some criticism, some questioning about the relevance of such mission today.
