- My body / my choice


It overhead me that people, chose to ban mifepristone in a whole state for religious reason, I live in the USA, this is the country of liberty, if faithful women (wiimen) don't want to abort, then that's their choice. Moreover, the sources that uses Matthew Kacsmaryk for example, a pro-life activist, are the most unreliable that I've ever seen, the documents that he refers are written by an unlicensed doctor. I don't say that the regulation of mifepristone is a negative thing, it is a drug, and like the others it should absolutely be considered to set rules over it.
