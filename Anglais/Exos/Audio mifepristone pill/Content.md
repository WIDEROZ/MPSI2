It overhead me that people, chose to ban mifepristone in a whole state for religious reason, I live in the USA, this is the country of liberty, if faithful women (wiimen) don't want to abort, then that's their choice. Moreover, the sources that uses Matthew Kacsmaryk for example, a pro-life activist, are the most unreliable that I've ever seen, the documents that he refers are written by an unlicensed doctor.
I don't say that the regulation of mifepristone is a negative thing, it is a drug, and like the others USA should absolutely consider to set rules on it. And for people who surgical abortion is a terrifying operation, mifepristone is the confortable solution for women.
My best friend fear surgical and mifepristone solution and for the moment, I don't have a clear answer to give her. So I would ask u if a real doctor can give me a response.
