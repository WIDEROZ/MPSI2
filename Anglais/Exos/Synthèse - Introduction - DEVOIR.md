# The issues of exploiting space.
## Introduction
Space exploitation is becoming more controverted, because of the Billionaires plans. That's why people can ask them if space can be used by private societies in despite of the greater good?
To answer the question, three documents are available : The first (DOC 3) is a picture taken in 1969 from the website : historic, showing the black community protesting against the Apollo 11 launching, the second (DOC 1) is an extract of an article from the Economist newspaper written the 18 July of 2019, exposing the issue of debris in space. Finally (DOC 2) is an audio from NPR, witch deals with actual issues about the space trafic.
