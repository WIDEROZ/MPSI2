#### To what extent, generations are so different
###### I. There is the context of the era where they are living
The period after war is more likely to give birth, because Gen B are considering that they have, a large weight on their shoulders due to the second war crisis and the ratio of deaths that the elder generation let them before. And this is also an idealist generation because they know the war. 

###### II. A consequence of this difference is that they haven't the same technological means
The generation Z live with the explosion of the smartphone, and the feature of the next generation will probably be the same because of the overuse of chat GPT for every domain in the life. 


###### III. Education issue
For example : people from the Gen B were educated by adults who fear the war and most of all, the lack of ressources, so they educated their children in order to make them not waste any peanut. All of this made a frustrated generation (Gen X), that led to this capitalist mentality.
