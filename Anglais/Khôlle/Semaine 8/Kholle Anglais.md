# Commentaire
- Can government really control tourism?
- 1. Government will never be able to control mass tourism ->
  - the economic factor is crucial to let them do what they want : it depends of social medias / of medias -> + goes to Zanzibar that time -> Paradise videos posted on social medias 
- 2. But Government can takes measures to make the phenomenon decrease ->
   - much more strict frontiers control to discourage people to came in their country for exemple North Korea limits the access to the country

Finally the government will never regulate tourism as they wish
